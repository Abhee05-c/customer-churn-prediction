# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains a Kaggle notebook and dataset for predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

- The notebook (`customer-churn-prediction.ipynb`) explores and models customer churn.
- The dataset (`dataset.csv`) contains customer data used for training and testing.

## Dataset

The dataset used includes features like customer demographics, account info, and service usage to predict churn.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pickle

Then, by saving the file using pickle and downloading it, i deployed the model into StreamLit for predicting the outcome. That is, the customer will churn(likely to unsubscribe the service) or not.
